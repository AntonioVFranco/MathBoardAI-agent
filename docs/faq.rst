Frequently Asked Questions ========================== This section answers common questions about using the MathBoardAI Agent system. Getting Started --------------- What is the MathBoardAI Agent? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The MathBoardAI Agent is a specialized AI system designed to solve complex mathematical problems across multiple domains. It combines OpenAI's GPT-4o for natural language understanding with SymPy for precise symbolic mathematics, providing step-by-step solutions with verification. **Key Features:** - Solves problems in algebra, calculus, linear algebra, optimization, and statistics - Provides step-by-step explanations - Verifies solutions for accuracy - Generates interactive visualizations - Supports both symbolic and numerical computations Do I need to install anything to use it? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ For the web interface, you only need: - A modern web browser - An OpenAI API key - Internet connection The system can be accessed through a web interface without any local installation. However, if you want to run it locally or contribute to development, you can use Docker or install the Python dependencies. How much does it cost to use? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The MathBoardAI Agent itself is free to use. However, you need an OpenAI API key, and you'll be charged for API usage based on OpenAI's pricing. Typical problems cost only a few cents to solve. **Cost factors:** - Simple problems: $0.01-0.05 per solution - Complex multi-step problems: $0.05-0.20 per solution - The system is optimized to minimize API calls while maintaining accuracy Technical Questions ------------------- What is an MCP and why do you use it? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ MCP stands for Model Context Protocol.
